# Activation_Function
Different types of activation functions

Some commonly-used activation functions in neural networks are:
1. Sigmoid activation function
   
Key features:

*The sigmoid function has an s-shaped graph.

*This is a non-linear function.

*The sigmoid function converts its input into a probability value between 0 and 1.

*It converts large negative values towards 0 and large positive values towards 1.

*It returns 0.5 for the input 0. The value 0.5 is known as the threshold value which can decide that a given input belongs to what type of two classes.
